# Introduction

This repo showcases an example where renovate breaks `devcontainer.json` when using `config:best-practices`

In the created [issue](https://github.com/lucasfijen/devcontainer_renovate_bug/pull/1) you will see that features in the devcontainer will receive a pinned sha tag, but this is unsupported by devcontainers.
